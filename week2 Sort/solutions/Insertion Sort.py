"""
Insertion Sort Algorithm

Problem Analysis:
- We need to sort an array of n integers in ascending order using insertion sort
- Insertion sort works by building a sorted portion from left to right
- For each element, we insert it into the correct position in the sorted portion

Algorithm Approach:
1. Start from the second element (index 1) as the first element is trivially sorted
2. For each element, compare it with elements in the sorted portion (to its left)
3. Shift all larger elements one position to the right to make space
4. Insert the current element into its correct position
5. Repeat until all elements are processed

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in worst case, O(n) in best case (already sorted)
Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting
Stability: Stable (equal elements maintain relative order)
